<b>About dataset</b></p>
This dataset compiles CO₂ emissions data sourced from FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) and IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), covering the years from 1990 to 2020.

# Introduction
Agrofood sector is large and essential, as food is a fundamental necessity for human survival and well-being. The industry include all activities activities within the 
food supply chain; farming, food production, processing, packaging, distribution and others along the line til consumption and food waste management.</p>
Current state of global warming is largely driven by greenhouse gas emissions, including CO₂. As the world strives for sustainability and net-zero goals, it is crucial 
to examine how essential aspects of human life—such as food production—contribute to emissions. Understanding and addressing these emissions is key to balancing food security 
with environmental responsibility.

Figure 1 shows the total CO₂ emissions of each country from 1990 to 2020, represented using a color scale ranging from yellow to red. The map clearly highlights China 
as the largest emitter, with a significantly red shade compared to other nations. China stands out as an outlier in terms of emissions.
