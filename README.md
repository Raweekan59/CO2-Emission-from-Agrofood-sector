# Introduction
Agrofood sector is large and essential, as food is a fundamental necessity for human survival and well-being. The industry include all activities activities within the 
food supply chain; farming, food production, processing, packaging, distribution and others along the line til consumption and food waste management.</p>
Current state of global warming is largely driven by greenhouse gas emissions, including CO₂. As the world strives for sustainability and net-zero goals, it is crucial 
to examine how essential aspects of human life—such as food production—contribute to emissions. Understanding and addressing these emissions is key to balancing food security 
with environmental responsibility.

<p align="center"> Fig.1 Total CO2 Emissions by Area</p><br>

Figure 1. shows the total CO₂ emissions of each country from 1990 to 2020, represented using a color scale ranging from yellow to red. The map clearly highlights China 
as the largest emitter, with a significantly red shade compared to other nations. China stands out as an outlier in terms of emissions.</p><br><br>

Figure 2. illustrates the total CO₂ emissions by decade to see how each country emission change. Emissions incease of countries can slightly be seen as China emission rise 
significantly in every decade.This map can conclude that China is the largest emitter since 1991 till 2020.

<p align="center"> Fig.3 Total CO2 emissions (exclude China) vs Average Teamperature change by area and decade</p><br>


Figure 3. presents comparative maps illustrating the emissions rate and temperature change of each country over decades. To enhance clarity, China has been excluded from the emissions maps, as its consistently high emission levels would otherwise dominate the color scale, making it difficult to observe variations in other countries. When analyzing both maps, a clear trend emerges—China's average temperature has steadily increased each decade, aligning with its rising emissions. In contrast, other countries display more irregular patterns, with temperature changes and emissions fluctuating without a consistent trend.</p>
<br>


Excluding China, the leading CO₂ emitters are the USA, Brazil, India, and Indonesia, though their rankings have shifted over the decades. From 1991 to 2010, Brazil was the second-largest 
emitter after China, but its emissions declined in the last decade. Meanwhile, emissions from the USA, India, and Indonesia have consistently risen over the last 30 years.</p>
<br>


In the first 20 years of the time series, top emitters that are open to water, like Brazil and Indonesia, show an increase in temperature. On the other hand, top emitters that share most of their borders with neighboring countries, such as China and the USA, experience temperature increases not only within their own borders but also in their neighboring countries, including Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Canada, and Greenland.</p>

# Agrofood CO2 emissions compared to Global CO2 emissions
"Agrofood: One of the Most Essential Sectors for Human Dependence"</p>
<b>How has this sector contributed to CO2 emissions over the past 30 years?</b></p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<p align="center"> Fig.4 Line graph of Agrofood vs Total CO2 emissions over time</p><br>


The line graph in Figure 4 shows that at first, agrofood emissions made up a large share of total emissions, with some constant remaining. 
By early 2010s, agrofood emissions nearly covered all emissions, with both rising slightly until 2020. Calculated values in the figure says that 
in 30 years, CO2 emissions from Agrofood sector accounted 86.75% in average and range from 76.60% to 97.28%.</p>


<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Relation of Agrofood and Overall CO2 emissions  </b></p>
<br>
Since agrofood emissions account for 70-90% of global emissions annually, it raises the question: <b>‘Is there a connection between agrofood and overall emissions of the highest agrofood emissions?’</b>
<br>

<p align="center"> Fig.5 Agrofood vs Total CO2 emissions by area and decade (exclude China)</p><br>


Figure 5 shows that the top emitters in the agrofood sector are the USA, Russia, India, and Indonesia, with Brazil reaching the top rank in the second decade. These countries also hold top ranks in overall emissions, as mentioned earlier.</p>
<br>

In India, the total emissions of the country largely come from agrofood, as indicated by the similar color patterns for both agrofood emissions and total emissions in all three decades.</p>
<br>

In Indonesia, the country's total emissions may partly stem from agrofood, as the color for total emissions has been a shade darker than that for agrofood in the last two decades.</p>
<br>

In Brazil, it is clear that the country's total emissions do not primarily come from agrofood. The decline in total emissions over the past decades suggests that the main source of emissions may have been reduced or halted, possibly due to the cessation of certain activities.</p>
<br>

Although the USA is the largest emitter in the agrofood sector, its total emissions are lower compared to countries like Brazil. This suggests that natural ecosystems in the USA may act as carbon sinks, reducing overall emissions. Similarly, Russia's total emissions are consistently lighter in shade compared to agrofood emissions over each decade, indicating that Russia might also function as a carbon sink. Both of these countries have vast land areas with large forests, which could help absorb carbon, leading to negative values for their emissions.</p>
<br>


To answer the question, there is no clear connection, but the data provides valuable insights that can lead to discussions on other sources of emissions in these countries.</p>

<p align="center"> Fig.6 Line graph of Agrofood CO2emissions by Category overtime with & without China </p><br>

Figure 6 shows a comparison of agrofood emissions by category over time, highlighting China's influence on the overall emission trend. From the graph, China's influence on 'Agricultural inputs and Manufacturing' emissions became significant after the year 2000, as emissions dramatically increased and doubled by 2020. Around the mid-2000s, emissions from 'Consumer & Waste Management', including China, began to increase slightly. Also, emissions from 'Food Processing & Distribution' rose to a constant level and remained stable until 2020. 
</p>
<br>
In conclusion, the change in China’s emission trends around the mid-2000s, followed by a constant rise, indicates significant changes or developments in China’s agrofood industry. However, from both line graphs provide the same outstanding categories of sources of agrofood emissions which are <b>'Agricultural inputs and Manufacturing' and 'Consumer & Waste Management'</p>

# Outstanding sources of Agrofood CO2 emissions

<p>Based on the emissions data across categories over time, the most outstanding sources of emissions are 'Agricultural Inputs and Manufacturing' and 'Consumer & Waste Management'. However, <b>'What are the trends for each specific source within these categories?</b>  </p>
<br>

***Agricultural Inputs and Manufacturing*** </p>

Figure 7. compares the trend of each source in Agricultural Inputs and Manufacturing, both with and without China, resulting in a similar pattern. The source that mainly drives emissions in this category is IPPU(Industrial Processes and Product Use). Its emissions start at a higher level and rise consistently, while the other sources begin at a quarter of that figure and remain steady.</p>
